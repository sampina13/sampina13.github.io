    <p> This is the calculations I did to find the right resistor for the job!</p>
    <h3>Additional Questions</h3>
    <p>Q1: Draw a chart where the X axis is time and the Y axis is voltage. Draw 3 lines representing the voltage across an LED with analogWrite(led, 64), analogWrite(led, 128), and analogWrite(led,255). </p>
    <img src="Fade! graph.jpg"/>
    <p>Q2: Given your schematic, circuit, and firmware, assuming the only thing that draws current is your LEDs, how long would your circuit run if powered by a 1200 mAh battery?</p>
    <img src="AQ2.1.jpg"/>
    <p>Assuming the button is pressed the whole time, the circuit would run for about 165.5 hours. </p>
    <img src="AQ2.2.jpg"/>
    <p>While the button is not pressed, the circuit would run for about 82.8 hours.</p
