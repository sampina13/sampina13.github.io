      <h1>The MP0 Writeup!</h1>
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>The first step I took to build my portfolio was reviewing
        the example code to see how each file corresponds to what
        is on the browser. Then, I planned for the style I wanted to have 
        for my portfolio by exploring different combinations of font families, 
        colors and sizes. Once the style was decided I then chose to code the 
        websites menu across the width of my site. After that, I added my content
        such as bio, cheatsheet, and mp0 writeup to their respective HTML pages.
        Finally, I added a css transition to the page by first searching online for
        ideas and watching tutorial videos on how to make it work, I went with a 
        background color change on the menu bar items.
      </p>
      <h2>Issue</h2>
      <p> I ran into some issues with the menu bar, particularly with making
        it stretch across the top of the page. I resolved this issue by struggling
        for a couple minutes on my own trying to get menu items aligned properly 
        but things would only get messier :/ so I searched the web for solutions 
        and realized that my syntax was incorrect in my index.css page. Once I 
        realized this it was easier to add my css transition onto the menu bar.
      </p>
      <h2>CSS Transition</h2>
      <p>The CSS transition I implemented was a background color change of the menu bar
        items when the cursor hovers over them. I chose it to add some more color 
        to my site without it being over the top and also for site users to have an
        easier time browsing.

      <h2>Ideas and Future</h2>
      <p> In the future I'll most likely add my resume and current portfolio
        projects I'm working on in my HCDE courses including research.
