    <h3> Additional Questions and Answers</h3>
    <p>1: Draw a graph where the X axis is time and the Y axis is voltage across the LEDs. Draw a line for each of your 3 LEDs. </p>
    <img src="graph.png" style="width:6000px;height: 500px;" />
    <p>2: How many LEDs could you blink independently with your Arduino? How much current would that draw? </p>
    <p> Answer: The most LEDs that could blink indepently with my Arduino is 14 at a current of about 200mA. See my work below. </p>

    <p>4: How fast do you need to blink your LEDs until you no longer can tell that they are blinking?</p>
    <p> Answer: I could not tell if they were blinking at a speed of 30ms</p>
